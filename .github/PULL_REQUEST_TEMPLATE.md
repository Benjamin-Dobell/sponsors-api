Open an issue and discuss changes before spending time on them, unless the change is trivial or an issue already exists.

Use the commit message format: `VERB some thing here. Closes #n`, where VERB is one of:

  - add
  - remove
  - change
  - refactor

If the change is documentation related prefix with "docs: ", as these are filtered from the changelog, for example:

  docs: add ~/.aws/config
